Iris Explorer
Iris Explorer
This project conducts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the classic Iris dataset. The primary objective is to analyze and visualize the distribution and relationships among various Iris species based on their morphological features — sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. This analysis helps in understanding the distinguishing characteristics of each species.
