🎯 Final Project Completed at OutriX 
I’m thrilled to share the successful completion of my Final Project as part of my internship at OutriX 🚀

✨ Tasks I Completed:
🔹 Project 1 – PDF Invoice Generator
 🧾 Designed a Python program that dynamically generates professional PDF invoices for clients.
 🧍 Accepted user input such as client name, purchased items, and total amount.
 📄 Used the ReportLab library to format and export invoice details into a downloadable PDF.
 ⚙️ Implemented clean layouts with automatic date generation and calculated totals for accuracy.
🔹 Project 2 – Command-Line Quiz Application
 🎯 Built an interactive command-line-based quiz app using Python.
 📚 Stored questions, options, and correct answers in structured data (lists/dictionaries).
 🧮 Tracked user responses, calculated total scores, and displayed results at the end.
 💡 Included features like question randomization and score summaries for an engaging experience.
🔹 Project 3 – Real-Time Weather Desktop App
 🌦️ Developed a GUI-based desktop application to display live weather updates.
 🏙️ Fetched real-time weather data from an online API based on user-input city names.
 🪟 Built with Tkinter for the interface and Requests for API handling.
 🌡️ Displayed temperature, humidity, and weather conditions in a clean, user-friendly layout.
🧠 These projects enhanced my practical skills in Python programming, GUI development, API integration, and file generation, combining both backend logic and frontend interaction.
🧰 Tech Stack Used: Python, Tkinter, FPDF, Requests, APIs, DateTime, Random, Conditional Logic, Functions, Loops, Input/Output, Exception Handling

Worked as a Python Developer Intern at OutriX, where I developed multiple real-world Python projects focused on GUI design, API integration, file handling, and data management.
Key projects completed during the internship include:

Basic Calculator (GUI) — Created a Tkinter-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using event-driven programming.

Weather App (API Integration) — Built a desktop application using Tkinter, Requests, and the OpenWeatherMap API to display real-time weather information for user-entered cities.

File Organizer Tool — Developed a Python script using OS and shutil modules to automatically organize files into categorized folders based on file types.

Quiz Application with Score Tracker — Implemented a command-line quiz app using Random and JSON/CSV modules to display randomized questions and track user scores.

PDF Invoice Generator — Designed a Python program using FPDF/ReportLab to dynamically generate professional PDF invoices from user input.
