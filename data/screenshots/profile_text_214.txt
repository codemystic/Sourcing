About
About
I am a passionate and dedicated developer with hands-on experience in Python, SQL, Flask, and web technologies. I learned Python during my BSc degree and continued strengthening my skills through personal projects and practice.

I completed my internship at Programmars.io India Private Limited (Jun 2023 – Sep 2023), where I worked specifically on AS400/IBM i. During the internship, I learned RPGLE, CLLE, and SQL, and built a Shopping Website Project on the IBM i platform. I successfully presented the project demo and received a completion certificate.

I have also built multiple projects and deployed them online using Git and GitHub, including:
• Personal Expense Tracker (Flask, SQLite, Matplotlib) – A full web application for managing income and expenses with authentication, filters, charts, and live hosting.
• Number Guessing Game (Python) – An interactive logic-based project uploaded and maintained on GitHub.

I enjoy learning new technologies, solving real-world problems, and building practical applications. I’m continuously improving my skills in Python, web development, databases, Git/GitHub, and deployment, and I look forward to contributing to impactful software projects.
