Just Started the LeetCode 75 Challenge!
I'm excited to improve my problem-solving skills with the 
hashtag
#LeetCode75 challenge.
 As a Python backend developer, I want to get better at DSA to build better systems and do well in interviews.
Finished Day 1 – staying consistent is the goal!
 Focus: Build strong logic, clear thinking, and more confidence.
If you're doing this too, let’s connect and learn together!

Dear Recruiters,
I'm a fresher Python backend developer, actively looking for a job. I’ve applied to many roles but didn’t get any response. I know the process is tough, but I really wish companies could share feedback. It would help us improve.

Not everyone is great at interviews, but many of us are good at real work. Sometimes it feels confusing—if we have skills, experience is asked… if we have a degree, still experience is needed. What should we do?

All I’m asking is a small chance to prove myself. If anyone can guide, refer, or suggest anything, I’d be very thankful.

Thank you for reading.
